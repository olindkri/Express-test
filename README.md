Before you can run the prototype, you need to do the following steps.

Write the following commands in the terminal or command promt:

If you want to edit this project, you will need to install SQLite.

Install SQLite:

  Windows:
   - Download this .zip file: https://www.sqlite.org/2023/sqlite-tools-win32-x86-3430100.zip
   - Create a new folder named (sqlite) at the root of your C: drive.
   - Export the data from the zip file to the new folder.
   - Open the sqlite3.exe file (you can close it after).
   - Open the file explorer and (right-click) on "This PC" and select properties.
   - Click on “Advanced System Settings” and then click on “Environment Variables”.
   - Under “System Variables”, find the “Path” variable and click on “Edit”.
   - Add the C:\sqlite directory to the list of paths separated by a semicolon.

  MacOS:
   - Open the terminal and run the command:
       $ brew install sqlite

  Linux:
   - Open a terminal and run the command:
       $ sudo apt-get install sqlite3


You can now run the prototype!
